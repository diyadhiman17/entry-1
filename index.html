    <h1>20's Toolkit: Self-help for the Self-Sabotaged</h1>

    <p>
        Having reached the ripe old age of twenty-three, I’ve gathered a treasure trove of valuable lessons—mostly from recent disasters.
        Naturally, I feel obligated to document all the wisdom I’ve stumbled upon (and promptly forgotten). 
        There’s just so much to impart, which is why I simply must capture these fleeting moments of enlightenment before they disappear forever.
        Here's how to go from being a hot <strong>mess</strong> to a <strong>hot</strong> mess.
    </p>

   <!-- <h2>The Lessons</h2> -->

    <ul style>
        <li>
            <h3>The Importance of Female Friendships</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Having a strong circle of female friends is like holding onto a life raft in a sea of chaos. These are the relationships that will remind you who you are, even when you forget.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <h3>Move Away from Your Hometown</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Staying where you grew up feels safe, but leaving forces you to grow in ways you never imagined. Trust me, distance has a funny way of giving you perspective.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <h3 >Do Not Cut Your Own Fringe</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p >You think you can do it. You can’t. Leave the DIY bangs for Pinterest fails and let a professional handle the scissors.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <h3>Fall Back in Love with Your Childhood Hobbies</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Remember that thing you used to love doing before life got complicated? It’s still there, waiting for you to rediscover it. Go on, indulge in a little nostalgia.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <h3 >Document Everything</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>You think you’ll remember it all, but you won’t. Write it down, take photos, keep notes. Future-you will thank you for capturing the chaos.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <h3 >You Don’t Have to Follow Every Passion to Its End</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p >It’s okay to start things and not finish them. Life isn’t a race to turn every hobby into a career—sometimes it’s just about enjoying the ride.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <h3 >The Myth of Work-Life Balance</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Work-life balance is less a reality and more of a juggling act where you’re always dropping something. The key is to pick up what matters and let the rest go.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <h3>Say No More Often</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Turns out, "no" is a complete sentence. Saying yes to everything is a fast track to burnout, so learn the power of a polite (or not so polite) refusal.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <h3>Don’t Date Skater Boys</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>They may look cool, but trust me, they’ll skate away from your feelings faster than you can say "emotional availability."</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <h3>Don’t Mix Alcohol and Weed</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>This isn’t one of those lessons you need to learn the hard way. Whether you’re going out or staying in, pick one vice at a time—your body will thank you.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <h3>Being Able to Do Things Alone is a Necessity</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>If you can’t take yourself out to dinner or go to the movies solo, you’re missing out on one of life’s greatest freedoms: independence. Learn to enjoy your own company.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <h3>Your Parents are People, Not Just Your Parents</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>It’s a hard pill to swallow, but your parents had lives, dreams, and mistakes long before you showed up. Understanding this can change your relationship with them.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <h3>Life Won’t Always Give You Closure</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Sometimes, you have to create your own closure. Whether it's a breakup, a lost opportunity, or an unfinished chapter, it’s up to you to move forward without waiting for the perfect ending.</p>
            </blockquote>
